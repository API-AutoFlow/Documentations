#### Updating by Pull Request

* Clone/Fork [API AutoFlow Github Repository](https://github.com/API-AutoFlow/Documentations/)
* Make appropriate changes and create a pull request

#### Design and development principles of this document:

1. Explain like you would to someone who doesn't know anything about the topic
2. Don't assume knowledge of the reader. Give explanations (or link) when additional concepts are mentioned. Don't leave areas where the read may get stuck from your explanation.
3. Embrace revisions

Remember, the goal of documentations is to help users who don't know about API AutoFlow find the information they need to successfully build their solution.
