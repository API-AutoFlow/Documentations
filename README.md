## How to make documentation updates

You can either make update directly from the Github website or clone the repository to make changes on your desktop.

All changes are reviewed and edited by the editors before being published.

#### Updating using Github website

* All the pages are located in the docs folder

#### Updating by cloning the repository

* Clone [API AutoFlow Github Repository](https://github.com/API-AutoFlow/Documentations/)
* Make appropriate changes and commit (fetch before committing to avoid conflict)

#### Design and development principles of this document:

1. Explain like you would to someone who doesn't know anything about the topic
2. Don't assume knowledge of the reader. Give explanations (or link) when additional concepts are mentioned. Don't leave areas where the read may get stuck from your explanation.
3. Embrace revisions

Remember, the goal of documentations is to help users who don't know about API AutoFlow find the information they need to successfully build their solution.
