The Services section is a collection of installed connectors. By default, AWS (Generic) and Oracle ORDS connectors are included.

When a developer installs a connector from the [Connector](https://docs.apiautoflow.com/docs/key-concepts/connectors/) section, it is made available in the Service section.
