# Object Put (Put value in a given key)
Puts the given value under key in map.

## Properties
```yaml
Object: Location of the object to add the value
Key: Key where the value is added
Value: The value to add
```

## Output
```yaml
Output-location: Location to store the output data
```

### Example 1
Let’s say we want to add the value of `3` in the key `a` of the object
```js
{a: 1, b: 2}
```

This will return
```js
{a: 3, b: 2}
```

### Example 2
Let’s say we want to add the value of `2` in the key `b` of the object
```js
{a: 1}
```

Since the key does not exist, it will create a new element and return
```js
{a: 1, b: 2}
```
