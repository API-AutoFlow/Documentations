# String Upcase (Capitalizes ALL characters)
Capitalizes the ALL characters in the string.

## Properties
```yaml
String: The string that’s been worked on.
```

## Output
```yaml
Output-location: Location to store the output data
```

### Example
Let’s say the data being worked on (target) is the response (output) body with value of `“hello world”`.  By applying Data Capitalize, the first character of the value is capitalized to `“HELLO WORLD”`
