# Servers
Server in API AutoFlow is [application server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_server) that hosts applications.

The servers can be viewed both on the Solution and Server pages.

The server page is simply a **List view** of the servers. When a large number of servers are created, it can be difficult to visualize them on the solutions.

One of the unique features of API AutoFlow is that there are no limits in the number of servers that can be created. The only limitation is the number of ports available.

## Starting & Stopping the Server
The servers can be turned on and off, renamed, and deleted.
