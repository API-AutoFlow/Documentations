```yaml
Array: Location of the list to chunk

Step: The steps into the enumerable each new chunk starts
Leftover: The value to fill the last chunk if not completely filled
```

## Output

```

### Example
Letâ€™s say we have a list with six elements.

```js
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
Group the chunk in elements of three.

Count: `3`

```
