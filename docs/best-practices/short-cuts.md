# Short Cuts
Using short cuts makes development faster and more efficient. Below are list of short cuts available on API AutoFlow.


## Cut, Paste, Delete Data
You can copy, delete, and paste data right from the data-type drop down.

### Paste Popup
When pasting, you will notice a text popup.  That is the text version of API AutoFlow configuration you are pasting. You don't have to worry about that for now.
