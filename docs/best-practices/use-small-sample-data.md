# Use a small sample data during development
Real-world use cases commonly involve a large set of data and events.  It would be impractical to develop using the large set as it would require a large amount of computing resources.  For example, a data file could be a few megabytes in size.

The best practice is to create a smaller data set (or reduced file size) to be used for the development.  A small set makes it easier to work with and speeds up development.
