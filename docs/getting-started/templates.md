For the rest of this tutorial, we will be working to build a simple solution that exposes data from Postgres database with custom API. If you’re not familiar with Postgres, don’t worry! No real Postgres experience is needed!

At this point, your development team is quite small and you’re simply building an app to prove out your MVP (minimum viable product). You want to show how it works and what it’s capable of doing without needing to think about how it will work for a large team, multiple developers, etc.

The sample solution is available from GitHub open-source configuration templates.
