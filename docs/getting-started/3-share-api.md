# Part 3: Share the APIs
---
You can share the APIs for the customers to use and co-developers to build the solution together.

1. Sharing the solution with customers and partners
2. Sharing the solution with co-developers

## 1. Sharing the solution with the customers
Well-written and structured API documentation that explains how to effectively use and integrate an API in an easy-to-comprehend manner will make a developer happy and eager to recommend the API to peers.

There are many good API documentation tools and methods. We've listed links to a few below.

At a most basic level, you need to share
* **The URL**:  In our solution, `http://api.apiautoflow.com/{your-id}/{your-server-name}/{your-endpoint-name}`
* **Method**:  In our solution, the method is a `GET`
* **Possible Input**:  We didn't configure our solution to take any Input
* **Expected Response**:  In our solution, the expected output is `Hello World!`

Those are the information you would provide the customers.

## 2. Sharing the solution with co-developers
In most cases, the solution will be co-developed with other people in your team.

The configuration can be downloaded and shared with your team members. They simply need to upload the configuration to their API AutoFlow to start working on the solution.
