# Part 3: Share the application
---
You can share the application both with the end-user and co-developers as you build the solution.

* Sharing the solution with customers and partners
* Sharing the solution with co-developers

## Sharing the solution with the end-user
Well-written and structured API documentation that explains how to effectively use and integrate an API in an easy-to-comprehend manner will make a developer happy and eager to recommend the API to peers.

Numerous content elements make good documentation, such as:

* A quick start guide
* Authentication information
* Explanations for every API call (request)
* Examples of every request and return with a response description, error messages, etc.

## Sharing the solution with a team member
In most cases, the solution will be co-developed with other people in your team.

The configuration can be downloaded and shared with the team member. They simply need to upload the configuration to their API AutoFlow install to start working on the solution.
