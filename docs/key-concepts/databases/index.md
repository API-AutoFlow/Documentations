# Databases
Out-of-the-box, API AutoFlow provides connectors for many popular databases. You can contact sales to add other databases to your solution.

There are two ways to integrate databases. The database `Action` is for single use and `Service` is for multiple uses.

## Database Actions
Each database action is a separate connection to the database.

## Database Service
Establish a connection with the database once that can be used throughout the solution.
