The API AutoFlow Dashboard
Before going too far, we want to highlight the API AutoFlow Dashboard, which gives you a full view of the solution. The API AutoFlow Dashboard is web based best suited to run on Chrome. It gives you access to all the features, lets you edit the solution, and lets you easily manage the solution lifecycle (stop, remove, etc.).

To access the dashboard, simply open your browser and got to
```
http://localhost:4000
```
or
```
http://{your_ip}:4000
```
Note, you can change the port number from the administration section of API AutoFlow.
