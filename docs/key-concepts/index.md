# Overview

API AutoFlow is an agile, no-code platform that enables the quick design and deployment of API endpoints that provide access to your applications or enables you to quickly build simple and complex applications by stitching together API-based services. An API AutoFlow endpoint is an application that runs as a service in your cloud or on-prem environment. You can build the components of an API endpoint using the visual editor or programmatically create using the JSON format supported by API AutoFlow. For information about the components used to build an API endpoint, see the sections below.

Getting started with API AutoFlow is easy, you will be able to deploy into your cloud environment or install locally, create a new API project, and run it directly from the visual editor.

To get started, see the API AutoFlow Getting Started GuideOverview below.

## What is API AutoFlow?
Now that youâ€™ve run API AutoFlow, what is API AutoFlow? Simply put, API AutoFlow is a simple and fast way to integrate and expose APIs.  Note the term API is used in a broad term as direct query to the databases and industry specific servers-clients (Kafka, MQTT, AMQT, Redis, etc) are also included in the product. For cloud users, you can think of API AutoFlow as an advanced application middleware or iPaaS.  From the user experience point of view, API AutoFlow is a no-code development tool, however it provides ways for developers to expand functionalities by applying code or scripts.  API AutoFlow is available as cloud, on-premise, and SaaS (coming soon).  The on-premise version being 40MBs and using minimal compute makes it ideal for running along-side existing legacy architecture to extend the capability.

At a high-level, three key features are provided.

API Integration: Over 3,000 built-in connectors
Logic Execution: Over 150 actions to easily handle data
API Exposure: Create servers and endpoints to provide data and service
