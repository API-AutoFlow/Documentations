# Overview
API AutoFlow is a simple and fast way to integrate and expose APIs. Note the term API is used in a broad term as direct query to the databases and industry specific servers-clients (Kafka, MQTT, AMQT, Redis, etc) are also included in the product. For cloud users, you can think of API AutoFlow as an advanced application middleware or iPaaS.  

For the developers, API AutoFlow is a no-code alternative to coding and scripting. It does not replace coding, but rather supplements by allowing the developed applications to be managed by non-technical teams.

API AutoFlow is available as cloud, on-premise, and SaaS.  The on-premise version being 70MBs and using minimal compute makes it ideal for running along-side existing legacy architecture to extend the capability.

At a high-level, three key features are provided.

* Integration: Over 3,000 built-in connectors
* Automation: Over 150 actions to easily handle data
* API Hosting: Create servers and endpoints to provide data and service
