## WYSIWYG backend
WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) is a concept where the software allows content to be created and edited in a form of visual resemblance.
API AutoFlow provides a true WYSIWYG experience for creating an application backend.
The user experience is similar to drawing a software flowchart. The difference is that after the drawing, the solution is ready for use.
The API AutoFlow WYSIWYG also follows many of BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) standards, making it easy for even non-developers.
