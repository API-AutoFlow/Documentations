# Actions
Actions are the basic building blocks for building the solution on API AutoFlow.

You daisy chain the actions to create the outcome you need. For example, to extract, transform, and load data from a database, you would use the below actions

1. [Database](https://docs.apiautoflow.com/docs/actions/database) Action to query the data
2. [Iteration](https://docs.apiautoflow.com/docs/actions/iteration) Action + [String](https://docs.apiautoflow.com/docs/actions/string) actions to transform the data
3. [Data Set](https://docs.apiautoflow.com/docs/actions/data/set/) Action to set the response.
