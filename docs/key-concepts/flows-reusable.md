# Re-usable Flows
As the solutions become complex, there are components that are used in multiple places.

Reusable flow is a way to create the flow once and apply it many time in the solution.

Conceptually it is similar to `functions` in programming. It takes an input and produces an output.

Reusable flows are created in a similar way to how flows are made in the solution section.
