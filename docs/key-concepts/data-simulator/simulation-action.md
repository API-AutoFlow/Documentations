# Data Simulation (Actions)
The actions that expect a response from another server can mock the expected response. The mock result feature can be turned on and off by clicking the check box **[C]**. The mock result is switched ON by default to avoid making unwanted calls to the server

The simulated mock data **[A]** is made available throughout the flow **[B]**.

> After you have configured the action, switch the mock data OFF **[A]** to receive the real data from the Server.  Cut and paste the data **[B]** back into the actionâ€™s mock data **[C]**. That way you are using the mocked data based on the real response.

> IMPORTANT ** Mock data only exists within the product**
>
> That means it's a good practice to perform a test with the real data once you complete building the solution with the mock data.
