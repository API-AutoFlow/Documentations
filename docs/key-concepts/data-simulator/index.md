## Simulating HTTP Request data
The process of creating a flow is to design a chain of actions that provides desired response to the request.  By simulating the request data within the product, developers can visualize the expected response as the flow is built and actions are applied.

## Simulating Actions Response data
Database and communication actions receive data from another server.  During development, it may not be ideal to execute those actions too many times for reasons such as rate limiting and slow responses delaying the development process.
