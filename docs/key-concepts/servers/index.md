# Servers
Server in API AutoFlow are [application server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_server) that hosts applications.

The servers can be viewed both in the Solution and Server pages.

Th server page is simply a **List view** of the servers. When a large number servers are created, it can be difficult to visualize them on the solutions.

One of the unique features of API AutoFlow is that there are no limits in the number of servers that can be created. The only limitation is the number of ports available.

## Starting & Stopping the Server
The servers can be turned on and off, renamed, and deleted.
