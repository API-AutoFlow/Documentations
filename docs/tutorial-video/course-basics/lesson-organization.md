## 1\. Reusable Custom Actions

Create once and reuse many times. For developers, you can think of it as functions.  It takes an `input` and gives back an `output`.  You create a custom action using a flow just like you would in a solutions section. The custom action can be applied in any flow.

In the below example, a simple custom action with [data/set](/docs/internal-actions/data/set/) is configured.  The action takes in the `input` data and sets the response as the `output` data.

How the data flow is explained below.

To apply the newly created custom action to the solution, go to actions **Flow* category

Drag and drop the newly created custom action to the flow. 

Apply the `input` and `output` value of the custom actions.  In the below example, we are taking the HTTP `request body` in the custom action `input` and putting the custom actions' `output` into the HTTP `response body`.

A paste pop-up will appear.  If you already copied an action, the pop-up will auto-populate.

If you are copying the configuration from another source, simply paste the configuration in the input box and press [OK].
