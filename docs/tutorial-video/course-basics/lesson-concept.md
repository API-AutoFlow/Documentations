## Definitions
The easiest way to understand API AutoFlow is to use a _factory_ as a comparison.  That is because whether you are building automation, ETL/ELT, or APIs for your database and systems, it is all about how you want to work with the data.

* __Solution__:  You can think of it as the factory itself. The solution refers to the entire backend
* __Server__: You can think of this as the freight receiving dock
* __Endpoint__: You can think of this as the start of the processing line
* __Flow__:  You can think of it as a process line for the data.  
* __Actions__: You can think of it as the workers who make changes to the raw materials
* __Data__: You can think of this as the raw material
* __Simulation__: You can think of it as the sample raw material
* __Flow Transaction Data__: You can think of it as the raw material that passes through the process line.  As changes are made by the actions, the flow transaction data would change as it goes down the flow.
