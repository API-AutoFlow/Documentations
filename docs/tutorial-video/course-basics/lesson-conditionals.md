Now that you have a good grasp of the fundamentals, let's look at how to create more complex solutions.

The conditionals are statements like **IF, Match, the Switch** that perform a set of actions when the conditions are met.

If you had any interest in technology, I am sure you have come across the **"IF"** condition (no pun intended).

**"Match"** is similar in a way that instead of `true` or `else`, it has a list of conditions.

## Lesson Outline

1. Apply `Conditional` action to the `flow`
2. Set condition rule
3. Apply actions to the conditions

## 1\. Apply `Conditional` action to the `flow`

From the `right navigation`, select the `conditional` category.

Drag and drop the `IF` condition to the flow

## 2\. Set condition rule

Select the **`IF`** action and use the drop-down to set the condition.

In the below example, we are selecting the `string/contains` a condition. **String/contains** checks whether the `target` contains a certain `string` value.

Let's set the target as `request/body`.

If the target `request/body` contains a `string` value **"Hello"**, the condition is `true`, otherwise, it is `else`.

To test the solution, you can use the `flow test simulation` to mock the `request/body`.

## 3\. Apply actions to the conditions

In the `true` part of the **IF** condition, apply the `data/set` action.

* Make the value **"True"**
* Make the output as **"response/body"**

You will notice that since the condition is true, it will execute the action "data/set" to return the value "True"
