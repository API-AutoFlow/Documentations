<p>API AutoFlow is an agile, no-code platform that enables the quick design and deployment of API endpoints that provide access to your applications or enables you to quickly build simple and complex applications by stitching together API-based services. An API AutoFlow endpoint is an application that runs as a service in your cloud or on-prem environment. You can build the components of an API endpoint using the visual editor or programmatically create using the JSON format supported by API AutoFlow. For information about the components used to build an API endpoint, see the sections below.</p>

<p>Getting started with API AutoFlow is easy, you will be able to deploy into your cloud environment or install locally, create a new API project, and run it directly from the visual editor.</p>

<p>To get started, see the API AutoFlow Getting Started GuideOverview below.</p>
